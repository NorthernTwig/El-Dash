## Hey! What's this?
It's a customizeable dashboard which can display a number of different things with the help of pixels! It currently supports these different sets of components:  

▶ The Time  
▶ The Weather  
▶ YouTube Subscribers  
▶ Customizable Text  
▶ Daily GitHub Commits

The dashboard is lightweight enough to run on a Raspberry Pi - if the animations are deactivated. But don't worry, they are off by default!

## What does this majestic dashboard look like?
It all depends on what components you choose to display, which colors you prefer, and if you are going for animations or not! But the dashboard could look like the following:

## .. And how do I use this?
You! Yes you! You can read about that in the [wiki](#)! Where every available component is properly explained, and also the setup process!

## Why don't you just write the instructions here?
This readme would be too long for you to handle which that amount of information!
